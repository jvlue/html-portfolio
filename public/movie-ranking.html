    <h3>3. Oblivion</h3>
    <p>Oblivion (2013) is a science fiction film directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, and Andrea Riseborough. It blends elements of post-apocalyptic survival with intriguing mysteries about identity and humanity. Here's a breakdown of the film:</p>
        
    <h4>Plot Summary:</h4>
        <p>The film is set in 2077, years after Earth was devastated by an alien invasion. Most of humanity has fled the planet, leaving behind a small population of survivors who live on Titan, one of Saturn's moons. Earth is now largely uninhabitable, with a barren landscape and remnants of human civilization destroyed by the alien race known as the Scavengers.</p>
        <p>Jack Harper (played by Tom Cruise) is a technician stationed in a remote area of the Earth, tasked with maintaining and repairing drones that protect vital resources from the remaining Scavengers. Jack works with his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), who communicates with him from a high-tech base in the sky. Their mission is to collect the last remaining resources to send back to the humans living on Titan.</p>
        <p>However, Jack begins to have strange dreams about a woman, Julia (Olga Kurylenko), and a crash he witnessed years earlier, which leads him to question the true nature of his mission. When he encounters a spacecraft that crash-lands on Earth, he finds Julia alive—she claims to have known him before, although he has no memory of her.</p>
        <p>As Jack uncovers more secrets about the past, he discovers that things are not as they seem. The Scavengers are not what they were thought to be, and the true history of Earth's fall and humanity's survival is far more complex than he imagined.
